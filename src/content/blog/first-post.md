# Westgate
### Description:
A seedy and squalid metropolis—with a history in piracy, powerful crime syndicates, and nameless vampiric crime-lords. It thrives on black-market trade and corruption, and is perhaps one of the most sordid cities in all of Faerûn. The legacy of scoundrels and spies was found in every alley, and danger lurked for the unprepared in every corner. Despite this, it was the largest and most powerful city on the Dragon Coast. It is an open city that welcomed all travelers and citizens alike as long as they abided by the local laws and, of course, had enough coin. It is probably the oldest, richest and most corrupt port on the Sea of Fallen Stars. It received the nickname "Gateway to the West" from its role as the Inner Sea's most prolific port city.

"Ah, Westgate. They say that this is the city where anything goes and everything has a price, and that's pretty much the truth. It's the most powerful city on the Dragon Coast and the most ruthless. My advice is to watch your back at all times, or get someone to do it for you." -The First Mate of the Sea Serpent.
### Religion:
- Westhavians tolerated the worship of a wide variety of gods, including evil gods, and were proud of their openness.
- The city's corruption extended to religious matters also, with clerics of some temples secretly pocketing donations.
- Many temples were all too happy to sell spellcasting services or healing potions to adventurers, as a way to earn coin.
### Culture
- One local chapbook of note was a mean-spirited Ambritur's Whip. The publication was penned by anonymous contributors and focused on negative coverage of local establishments and events, as well as spreading gossip and rumors.
- Slang
	- Pigeon pinch: An ambush during which a courier is attacked by two groups of enemies: one to distract the target and its allies, the other to steal whatever it's carrying.
- A person from Westgate was known as a Westar or a Westhavian.
